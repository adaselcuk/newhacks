# Rescue Hub
## by Ada Selcuk, Hiya Thakkar, Manali Bisht

### Inspiration
We wanted to create a website to help people concerned about natural disasters before they hit. People who have unique circumstances who might not have time to search how to prepare can quickly use a chatbot to get the answer.

### Features
- Gemini Chatbot finetuned to express specific information, received from the Government of Canada, for each natural disaster and circumstance 
- Map to view your location and safe evacuation areas around the city
- Community feature to ask for resources or give resources in the effort of preparing for the natural disaster

## Future Improvements
- Have a login feature for volunteers or government officials to sign up to express safe evacuation zones on the map
